# homespaces

Homespaces is a rust based application aiming to help you create a distraction free environment for any task. Add desired apps to your homespace by their names and freely switch between them.

## Features

For now, the only planned feature is the ability to create said homespaces - steps are covered in the roadmap section.

## Usage

TODO

## Roadmap (work in progress)

The must have section is meant only for Windows - support of other systems is one of nice to haves.

Must have:

- List of all installed applications
- Creating a homespace - a way of interacting with Windows Explorer so that only selected application shows (without choice)
- Adding applications to a homespace
- Homespace file - so that it can be saved and loaded from

Nice to have:

- MacOS support
- Linux support (will probably be seperated for different desktop environments)
- GUI
