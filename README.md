# homespaces

Homespaces is a rust based application aiming to help you create a distraction free environment for any task. Add desired apps to your homespace by their names and freely switch between them.

## Features

For now, the only planned feature is the ability to create said homespaces - steps are covered in the roadmap section.

## Usage

Right now the only possibility is to download the source code and run it yourself - Rust required.

## Roadmap (work in progress)

While this roadmap might seem small, I have more of a personal roadmap towards learning Rust in order to be able to achieve below points.

The must have section is meant only for Windows - support of other systems is one of nice to haves.

Must have:

- [ ] List of all installed applications
- [ ] Running a single application
- [ ] Running multiple applications and keeping track of them
- [ ] Integrating with Virtual Desktop API to spawn necessary processes
- [ ] Creating a homespace
- [ ] Adding applications to a homespace
- [ ] Homespace file - so that it can be saved and loaded from

Nice to have:

- MacOS support
- Linux support (will probably be seperated for different desktop environments)
- GUI
